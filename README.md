If I haven't already explained, I will not be giving you plain binaries instead I supply you with the code and you can do whatever you want with it.
However if one does not know how to compile code then if asked I can supply you with a binary but I will only do this for Linux, Unix and Unix-like OS's. If you do not use a Linux, Unix or a Unix-like OS you are on your own.
If you disregard this Info and request a non Linux, Unix or Unix-Like binary I will merely send you a copy of this file for every request.
This is because of my lack of enjoyment, caring, like, support of Non Unix-like OS,s.
